INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING VIROUS
==========================

This file contains instructions on how to set up and use the Virous project.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
-----------------

1. Make sure you have XAMPP installed on your computer
   - Download from: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html if you don't have it

2. Start Apache and MySQL services from XAMPP Control Panel

3. Set up the database:
   - Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
   - Create a new database named "virous_data"
   - Import the virous_data.sql file
   - Or run the SQL commands manually from the file

4. Test the setup:
   - Open http://localhost/virous/play_virous.php in your browser
   - You should see a loading screen with a progress bar

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
-----------------

1. To create a link that you can send to someone:
   - Make sure your computer is accessible from the internet
   - You may need to set up port forwarding on your router to port 80
   - Or use a service like ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) to create a tunnel

2. Get your public IP address or domain:
   - Visit https://whatismyip.com/ to find your public IP
   - Or use your domain name if you have one

3. Create the link:
   - The link will be: http://YOUR_IP_OR_DOMAIN/virous/play_virous.php
   - Send this link to the target

4. When the target opens the link on their mobile device:
   - The page will request fullscreen access
   - It will disable device buttons and prevent normal navigation
   - It will attempt to collect account information and other data
   - All collected data will be sent back to your database

5. View collected data:
   - Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
   - Select the "virous_data" database
   - Browse the "victim_data" table
   - All collected information will be stored here

IMPORTANT NOTES:
--------------

1. This tool is for educational purposes only

2. Using this to collect data without consent is illegal in most jurisdictions

3. The effectiveness of button/screen disabling varies by device and browser

4. Modern browsers have security measures that prevent many of these techniques

5. Some features may not work on all devices or browsers

TROUBLESHOOTING:
--------------

1. If the database connection fails:
   - Check that MySQL is running
   - Verify database credentials in play_virous.php
   - Make sure the virous_data database exists

2. If the page doesn't load properly:
   - Check that Apache is running
   - Verify file permissions
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

3. If data isn't being collected:
   - Modern browsers block many data collection methods
   - The user may have denied permissions
   - Check browser console for errors
